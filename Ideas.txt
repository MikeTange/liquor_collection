IDEAS FOR LIQUOR COLLECTION PROJECT:

Essentially a database to be accessed through an app. First draft will be without an app or anything - just python script. 
Second step might be turning it into a web application. Finally, turning it into an app. 

The basis for the Python script will be a sort of logger, containing a bunch of information for each bottle. Not every bottle needs all information to be provided. 
The information will be stored on a per-bottle basis. The information will be:
- type of liquor (whisky, gin, etc.)
- datestamp (when consumed, bought, added, or something else)
- a picture of the glass / bottle (or multiple pictures)
- a rating (10-point scale), with possible sub-ratings
- location where we had it

For whiskys specifically:
- type of whisky (Bourbon, Scotch, Irish, etc.)
- region of the whisky (particularly for Scotch)
- brand / label
- age
- edition
- aging casket(s)
- bottling year
- taste (nose, notes & finish)

For gins:
- country
- region
- type (e.g., spicy)
- tonic(s) to pair with
- herbals / florals


First ideas / challenges for the Python script:

Challenge: how to store the data?
Idea(s): OOP format, Pandas dataframe

Challenge: how to save the data?
Idea(s): JSON (?), .txt

Challenge: how to interact with the script to add new entries?
Idea(s): input prompt, sending a picture & auto-filling details through Google image search
